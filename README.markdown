# About

This was forked from the iBattery repo, described here: http://custardbelly.com/blog/2011/09/21/air-native-extension-example-ibattery-for-ios/

The current purpose of this repo is to demonstrate a linkage bug when trying to build an application that uses Accelerate.framework

To simulate the linkage failure, go to flash/air and run ./build.sh with your .mobileprovision file, .p12 file, and the password for it
